## Brief overview

**Detect_revision** is a focused utility for managing **multibind** profiles on DJI controllers **RC Pro (RM510B)** and **RC Plus (RM700)**. The tool detects hardware/firmware revisions on USB connect, allows exporting/importing bind profiles, performs non-destructive diagnostics and generates audit-friendly logs. Intended for service centers, integrators and advanced users who require quick checks and profile management without invasive firmware modification.

## Key features

- 🔎 **Revision detection** of controller and radio module upon connection.  
- 🔀 **Multibind profile handling**: create, view, export, import (profile operations are reversible).  
- 💾 **Backup & restore** of controller settings and bind profiles.  
- 🧾 **Logging & diagnostics**: public firmware versions, module identifiers and error traces.  
- ⚙️ **Compatibility** with RM510B and RM700 — shows compatible bind modes and suggested profiles.  
- 🔐 **Safety-first**: the app does not attempt to bypass protections or modify secure device IDs.  
- 🧩 **Export formats**: JSON/CSV for audits, ticketing and service records.

---

## Advanced (concise)

- 📡 Monitor radio module metrics (RSSI, module status) in live mode.  
- 🧰 CLI support for batch processing of multiple devices and scripted workflows.  
- 🔄 Template profiles for fleet provisioning and quick deployment.  
- 🧾 Generate device ↔ profile compatibility reports for service documentation.

## Limitations & legal/safety notice

- Detect_revision is **not** intended for circumventing device protections, unlocking features or altering secure identifiers.  
- Operate only on devices you own or when explicitly authorized.  
- Respect warranty terms and applicable regulations; when in doubt, use official service channels.  
- Always make backups before applying profile changes.

## Quick start (safe flow)

1. Download Detect_revision from an official/distributor source.  
2. Extract and run `Detect_revision.exe` (run as admin if driver install required).  
3. Connect the RC via USB; wait for device detection.  
4. Click **Detect** to read revision and available bind modes.  
5. Export profiles with **Export** and import them later with **Import**.  
6. Use `--batch` CLI option for folder-based processing of many devices.
